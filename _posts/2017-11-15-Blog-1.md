    <td>Hi everyone today I am going to tell you about myself and what inspired me to bake and dance.The way I got inspired to bake was because of my mum's passion for baking.She made each of our cakes every year. Now as I am slowly getting into baking, my first cake I made by myself was a chocolate cake then a marble cake and finally the next cake I want to make is a watermelon cake with dark and light green buttercream with a red velvet cake inside. </td>
